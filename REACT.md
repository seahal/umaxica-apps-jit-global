# React Purity

Render must be a pure computation. The three principles below are independent, and violating any one
breaks purity.

- **Idempotent**: Components and hooks must return the same result for the same inputs, regardless
  of how many times or when they are called. Never produce values during render that depend on call
  count or timing. e.g. `new Date()`, `Math.random()`, `crypto.randomUUID()`, direct `fetch()`,
  incrementing an ID counter.
- **No side effects in render**: Render only computes JSX, so it must not observe or change the
  outside world. Side effects belong in `useEffect` or event handlers. e.g. `document.title = ...`,
  `window.scrollTo()`, observational `console.log()`, writes to a global store. The
  memoization-cache exception under "No mutation of non-local values" applies here equally: a
  semantically transparent cache write is not an observable effect.
- **No mutation of non-local values**: Only values created within the current render call may be
  mutated. Module-scope and shared objects are off-limits. e.g. `push` into a module-scope array,
  incrementing a counter declared outside the function, mutating properties of an argument object.
  The single exception is a semantically transparent memoization cache: module-scope, keyed purely
  by the function's inputs, written idempotently (same key always yields the same value), and
  observable by nothing but the memoized function itself. Mutating one during render changes no
  rendered output, so idempotence is preserved.

# React Calls Components and Hooks

- **Never pass hooks as values**: Don't pass hooks as props, arguments, or return values. A hook
  must be called directly and statically inside the component or hook that uses it. e.g.
  `<Button useData={useDataWithLogging} />`, returning a hook from a factory function, storing a
  hook in a variable and calling it conditionally.
- **Never create higher-order hooks**: Don't wrap or compose hooks dynamically at call time. Inline
  the logic into a new named hook instead. Given `const useDataWithLogging = withLogging(useData)`,
  write a `useDataWithLogging` hook that calls `useData` and the logging directly.

# You Might Not Need an Effect

The deciding question: is this code running because the user did something (event), or because the
component appeared on screen (sync with external system)? Only the latter justifies `useEffect`.

- **Derived values**: Never `useEffect` + `setState` to transform props/state into another state.
  Compute inline or `useMemo` for expensive calculations.
- **State reset on prop change**: Don't `useEffect(() => setX(initial), [prop])`. Give the component
  a `key={prop}` so React remounts it with fresh state.
- **Partial state adjustment on prop change**: Derive the value from existing state/props instead of
  syncing with an effect. e.g. store `selectedId` instead of `selectedItem`, and derive the item via
  `items.find()`.
- **Effect chains**: Multiple effects where each sets state that triggers the next is a sign that
  the logic belongs in a single event handler that batches all state updates at once.
- **Notifying parent of state change**: Don't `useEffect(() => onChange(value), [value])`. Call
  `onChange` directly in the same event handler that calls `setValue`.
- **useEffect is not componentDidMount**: Don't think of `useEffect(() => {}, [])` as "run once on
  mount." An effect synchronizes with external systems whenever its reactive dependencies change.
  Mount and update are a single unified lifecycle. When you want "skip on initial render," reframe:
  the real need is usually an early return based on state value (e.g.
  `if (roomId === null) return;`), never a ref-based "first render" flag.

# Synchronizing with External Systems

Corollaries of "You Might Not Need an Effect" for things that genuinely live outside React (fonts,
observers, canvas, storage).

- **useSyncExternalStore for external readiness**: When "is X ready?" comes from an external system
  (font loading, media queries, storage), don't mirror it with `useState` + effect. Keep a
  module-level store (subscribe / snapshot) and read it with `useSyncExternalStore`. Its server
  snapshot (`() => false`) doubles as the SSR/hydration guard, replacing the `mounted`-flag pattern.
- **Module scope for app initialization**: Once-per-page-load work (injecting a stylesheet link,
  kicking off an initial resource load) runs at module level behind an `import.meta.env.SSR` guard,
  never in a `[]` effect. Once per app is not once per mount.
- **Event handlers trigger resource loads**: When a user choice requires loading an external
  resource, start the load in the change handler that made the choice. If the handler needs the
  post-patch state, predict it by calling the pure transition function (`transition(state, patch)`).
  Never add an effect that watches the state to react to it.
- **Transition functions own state invariants**: When one field constrains another (the selected
  option must remain valid for the newly chosen group), enforce it inside the pure transition
  function (a reducer or a plain exported function) on every patch. No adjust-state-in-effect, no
  re-clamping at every read site.
- **Expensive derivation is still derivation**: A computation that uses the DOM as a calculator
  (offscreen-canvas text measurement) belongs in `useMemo` during render when it is idempotent and
  memoized. The module-level cache (keyed by inputs) shares results across component instances and
  remounts, while `useMemo` avoids redundant cache lookups within a single instance's re-renders, so
  both layers are needed. An effect copying results into state replaces neither. Gate the
  computation on the external readiness snapshot so it never runs during SSR.
- **Callback refs with cleanup for element observers (React 19)**: Attach ResizeObserver /
  IntersectionObserver to an element in a callback ref that returns a cleanup, never in a mount
  effect. Read measurements procedurally at use time (`el.clientWidth` at draw time) instead of
  mirroring them into state when the consumer is imperative anyway.
- **Latest-ref for callbacks that outlive renders**: A subscription that must run "the current
  logic" calls `latestRef.current()`, and the sync effect updates the ref each render. This avoids
  re-subscribing per render and stale closures.
- **The last effect standing must read as a sentence**: After the above, every remaining `useEffect`
  should read as "synchronize [external system] with [rendered value]" (e.g. paint the canvas from
  the computed layout). An effect that doesn't fit that sentence has a better home.

# Component Splitting

- **Re-render boundaries**: A component boundary is also a re-render boundary. When parts of a UI
  update at different frequencies, split them into separate components so expensive subtrees don't
  re-render unnecessarily. When a library offers both a hook API and a render-props/component API,
  prefer the one that isolates re-renders to the smallest scope.
- **Generic component naming**: Props of generic/reusable components should follow standard HTML
  attribute and platform conventions to minimize mental mapping cost. e.g. `<MyImage src={url} />`
  rather than `<MyImage imageUrl={url} />`. For controlled/uncontrolled patterns, follow the Radix
  convention: `open`/`onOpenChange`/`defaultOpen` rather than `isVisible`/`onToggle`.
- **Transparent native wrappers**: UI-library-level components wrapping a native element (`input`,
  `button`, `a`) should accept all native attributes via `ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"input">` and
  spread them. Don't restrict props to a handpicked subset, because that blocks a11y attributes and
  makes the wrapper worse than the raw element.
- **Event handler props name intent, not mechanism**: Callback props represent what the component
  communicates, not how the user interacts. Naming after the DOM event (`onClickPlay`) couples the
  interface to a specific interaction, breaking when the trigger changes to keyboard, gesture, or
  programmatic call. e.g. `onPlayMovie` rather than `onClickPlayMovie`.
- **Minimal props (avoid stamp coupling)**: A child that receives more data than it needs is coupled
  to the parent's data shape and re-renders when unrelated fields change. Pass the narrowest data
  that satisfies the child's responsibility. e.g. `<ArticleTitle title={article.title} />` rather
  than `<ArticleTitle article={article} />`.
- **useReducer for stable callbacks**: A callback that closes over state breaks identity stability,
  and `useCallback` cannot help because its deps include the state. `useReducer` eliminates this by
  design: `dispatch` is identity-stable, and state access moves into the reducer. Reach for
  `useReducer` when callbacks and state are intertwined, rather than only when state shape is
  complex.
- **Reactive vs procedural API**: Libraries offer both reactive APIs (subscribe and re-render on
  change: a form library's `watch()`, a data-fetching hook) and procedural APIs (read or act on
  demand: `getValues()`, an imperative mutation call). Match the API to the trigger: display-driven
  → reactive, user-action-driven → procedural/mutation. Never use a reactive data-fetching hook for
  user-initiated fetches, and never call a reactive watcher inside an event handler.

# Testable Behavior Extraction

When internal state drives a component's behavior or appearance, structure it so every branch is
drivable from outside, with tests injecting inputs and asserting outputs. Needing a chain of setup
interactions on the component itself, or a test-only backdoor, to reach a code branch means the
design hid what should have been an input.

- **State transitions → exported pure functions**: Branching transition logic is an exported pure
  function, and event handlers call it: `setState(transition(state, input))`. Reducer ceremony
  (action types, dispatch, switch) is not required for this, since "useReducer for stable callbacks"
  is the reason to reach for `useReducer` rather than transition structure. Tests call the function
  directly.
- **Branching render → a component taking the discriminant as props**: When state selects between
  visuals, each variant is its own component, and the selection itself is a component whose props
  carry the discriminating state, typed as a discriminated union so one variant cannot receive
  another's data. Both are pure props → JSX mappings, so tests render each branch by passing the
  state directly.
- **What remains in the parent**: `useState`, handlers calling the transition functions, and JSX
  passing state down. The parent holds no branch worth testing, so its test is a thin wiring check.
- **What stays internal**: Presentation-local state with no branch worth testing (hover, a tooltip's
  open flag) stays inside, because externalizing it couples parents to state that is not their
  concern. The dividing test is whether a test needs to reach a branch on this value. Where it does,
  extract as above. Where it does not, keep it internal.
- **Never expose internals for tests**: no exported setters, no mocked hooks, no test-only props. An
  initial-state prop (`defaultOpen`) is a real API under "Generic component naming" rather than a
  test hook, and that tests can start from any state is a byproduct.

# Module Organization

- **No pass-through layers**: Don't create components that only receive props and forward them to a
  child. A component that adds no logic, layout, or abstraction is an intermediate layer that
  deepens the dependency chain and obscures data flow. Keep the tree flat where possible.
- **Colocation over classification**: Don't organize by technical role (`hooks/`, `atoms/`,
  `utils/`). Place modules next to where they're used. Colocation limits scope by default, because a
  module in a feature directory is implicitly private to that feature. Classification directories
  force everything to be "potentially reusable," increasing cognitive load. Only generic modules (no
  domain knowledge, so they could ship as a library) belong in shared directories. A small
  domain-specific component belongs with its feature, rather than in a shared directory because of
  its size. Classify by purpose (data fetching, domain types and schemas), rather than by
  implementation mechanism (hook → `hooks/`). A single concern (e.g. "posts API") often exports a
  type, a query factory, an async function, and a hook. Keep them together in one directory instead
  of scattering them across `/types`, `/hooks`, `/utils`.
- **Small for complexity, not reuse**: The purpose of extracting a module is to reduce complexity
  and limit its scope of usage, rather than to make it reusable. A module used in exactly one place
  is fine, provided it has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **No ceremony for small modules**: Don't wrap every small component in its own directory with
  `index.ts`. Place files directly in the parent directory. The overhead of a directory plus a
  re-export barrel for each module discourages the fine-grained splitting this rule exists to
  encourage.
- **Directories mirror exclusive ownership**: Inside a feature, create a subdirectory only when a
  parent exclusively owns its children (a control panel and its private field/slider/toggle
  components). Imports decide exclusivity, and JSX nesting does not. A component consumed by two
  parents has lost exclusivity: move it up to the nearest common ancestor, or to the shared
  components directory when the consumers are different features. Within a feature, never a
  directory for a single file (shared components are the exception: each shared concern gets its own
  directory).
- **A web of functions is one box**: "Place a function in its caller's directory" only works when
  the call graph is a tree. When modules form a web (a measurement/layout engine whose parts call
  each other and share constants/types), group the whole concern in one purpose-named directory
  (`engine/`) instead of nesting by caller. Otherwise nobody owns the shared pieces and the tree
  churns on every refactor.
- **Cross-feature sharing has two homes**: Shared components go to the shared components directory,
  and shared non-component values with no component affinity (a repo URL) go to the shared library
  directory. One feature must never import from another feature's directory. The exception to the
  library-directory rule: a style-string constant tied to one shared component colocates next to
  that component in its own `.ts` file (never co-exported from the component file).
- **CSS backing a shared class loads globally**: A colocated feature stylesheet only loads when that
  feature's component is imported. When a class is used across features (a shared link treatment),
  its rules belong in the global stylesheet. Otherwise a route that never mounts the owning feature
  silently loses them.
