  Grounds framework-specific implementation decisions in official documentation and cites the
  source. Use before writing framework or library code from memory, when building boilerplate that
  will be copied across a project, when the framework's recommended approach matters (forms,
  routing, data fetching, state management, auth), or when the user asks for verified or documented
  implementation.

# Source-Driven Development

Training data goes stale: APIs get deprecated and recommended patterns change, so a remembered
signature can look correct and still be wrong for the installed version. Verify against the official
docs, then cite the source so the user can check it.

**When NOT to use:** correctness that does not depend on a version (renames, typos, file moves),
pure logic that behaves the same across versions, or when the user has asked for speed over
verification.

## The Process

```
DETECT ──→ FETCH ──→ IMPLEMENT ──→ CITE
  │          │           │            │
  ▼          ▼           ▼            ▼
 What       Get the    Follow the   Show your
 stack?     relevant   documented   sources
            docs       patterns
```

### Step 1: Detect Stack and Versions

Read the project's dependency file to identify exact versions:

```
package.json    → Node/React/Vue/Angular/Svelte
composer.json   → PHP/Symfony/Laravel
requirements.txt / pyproject.toml → Python/Django/Flask
go.mod          → Go
Cargo.toml      → Rust
Gemfile         → Ruby/Rails
```

State what you found explicitly:

```
STACK DETECTED:
- React 19.1.0 (from package.json)
- Vite 6.2.0
- Tailwind CSS 4.0.3
→ Fetching official docs for the relevant patterns.
```

If versions are missing or ambiguous, **ask the user**. Don't guess — the version determines which
patterns are correct.

### Step 2: Fetch Official Documentation

Fetch the specific documentation page for the feature you're implementing. Not the homepage, not the
full docs — the relevant page.

**Source hierarchy (in order of authority):**

| Priority | Source                        | Example                                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Official documentation        | react.dev, docs.djangoproject.com, symfony.com/doc |
| 2        | Official blog / changelog     | react.dev/blog, nextjs.org/blog                    |
| 3        | Web standards references      | MDN, web.dev, html.spec.whatwg.org                 |
| 4        | Browser/runtime compatibility | caniuse.com, node.green                            |

**Not authoritative — never cite as primary sources:**

- Stack Overflow answers
- Blog posts or tutorials (even popular ones)
- AI-generated documentation or summaries
- Your own training data (that is the whole point — verify it)

**Be precise with what you fetch:**

```
BAD:  Fetch the React homepage
GOOD: Fetch react.dev/reference/react/useActionState

BAD:  Search "django authentication best practices"
GOOD: Fetch docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/auth/
```

After fetching, extract the key patterns and note any deprecation warnings or migration guidance.

When official sources conflict with each other (e.g. a migration guide contradicts the API
reference), surface the discrepancy to the user and verify which pattern actually works against the
detected version.

### Step 3: Implement Following Documented Patterns

Write code that matches what the documentation shows:

- Use the API signatures from the docs, not from memory
- If the docs show a new way to do something, use the new way
- If the docs deprecate a pattern, don't use the deprecated version
- If the docs don't cover something, flag it as unverified

**When docs conflict with existing project code:**

```
CONFLICT DETECTED:
The existing codebase uses useState for form loading state,
but React 19 docs recommend useActionState for this pattern.
(Source: react.dev/reference/react/useActionState)

Options:
A) Use the modern pattern (useActionState) — consistent with current docs
B) Match existing code (useState) — consistent with codebase
→ Which approach do you prefer?
```

Surface the conflict. Don't silently pick one.

### Step 4: Cite Your Sources

Every framework-specific pattern gets a citation. The user must be able to verify every decision.

**In code comments:**

```typescript
// React 19 form handling with useActionState
// Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState#usage
const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(submitOrder, initialState);
```

**In conversation:**

```
I'm using useActionState instead of manual useState for the
form submission state. React 19 replaced the manual
isPending/setIsPending pattern with this hook.

Source: https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19#actions
"useTransition now supports async functions [...] to handle
pending states automatically"
```

**Citation rules:**

- Full URLs, not shortened
- Prefer deep links with anchors where possible (e.g. `/useActionState#usage` over
  `/useActionState`) — anchors survive doc restructuring better than top-level pages
- Quote the relevant passage when it supports a non-obvious decision
- Include browser/runtime support data when recommending platform features
- If you cannot find documentation for a pattern, say so explicitly:

```
UNVERIFIED: I could not find official documentation for this
pattern. This is based on training data and may be outdated.
Verify before using in production.
```

Honesty about what you couldn't verify is more valuable than false confidence.

## Red Flags

- Writing framework-specific code without checking the docs for that version
- Using "I believe" or "I think" about an API instead of citing the source
- Implementing a pattern without knowing which version it applies to
- Citing Stack Overflow or blog posts instead of official documentation
- Using deprecated APIs because they appear in training data
- Not reading `package.json` / dependency files before implementing
- Delivering code without source citations for framework-specific decisions
- Fetching an entire docs site when only one page is relevant

## Verification

After implementing with source-driven development:

- [ ] Framework and library versions were identified from the dependency file
- [ ] Official documentation was fetched for framework-specific patterns
- [ ] All sources are official documentation, not blog posts or training data
- [ ] Code follows the patterns shown in the current version's documentation
- [ ] Non-trivial decisions include source citations with full URLs
- [ ] No deprecated APIs are used (checked against migration guides)
- [ ] Conflicts between docs and existing code were surfaced to the user
- [ ] Anything that could not be verified is explicitly flagged as unverified
