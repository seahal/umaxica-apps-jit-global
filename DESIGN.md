# Design System

## Overview

Token values are defined in `src/styles.css`: shadcn/ui's neutral base, kept achromatic for every
surface and text role, with a hue only on `destructive` and the chart series, and a radius scale
derived from `--radius`. That base is a starting point rather than an identity, so a project that
wants a palette, a typeface, or a corner treatment of its own replaces the values there and leaves
the rules below alone.

This document governs how those tokens are used. A token value changes in `src/styles.css` and never
here. Keyboard behavior, forms, hydration, and performance sit outside its subject.

## Colors

### Semantic Roles

- **primary**: Main actions. Never as a background fill.
- **secondary**: De-emphasized actions.
- **muted / muted-foreground**: Helper text, placeholders, disabled states.
- **accent**: See Accent Color below.
- **destructive**: Deletion and error actions only. Not for general warnings.
- **border / input**: Structural separation. Subtle, never dominant.

### Accent Color

Accent is one hue applied consistently to a chosen category of elements. Pick which element types
carry accent, then apply it to ALL instances of that type, never selectively. Mixing strategies
(some links colored, some not) reads as inconsistency rather than design.

- Match the accent's undertone to the neutral palette. Cool neutrals pair with cool accents, and
  cross-temperature creates tension.
- Apply the accent as a value step, usually desaturated, rather than as a saturated fill. Where
  every accent on a screen is the same vivid swatch, the screen reads as a template.
- Derive hover/active variants by adjusting lightness, never by picking new colors.
- Accent is independent of destructive. Never use the accent hue for errors or warnings.
- On landing pages, accent also appears in brand visuals (logo, hero, illustrations). On app UIs,
  accent stays on interactive elements only.

### Color Usage Rules

- Never rely on color alone to convey state. Always pair it with shape, icon, or text.
- When deriving hover/disabled/active variants, verify contrast against WCAG AA (4.5:1 for text, 3:1
  for UI elements). Perceptually uniform color spaces do not exempt you from contrast checking.
- Keep distinguishable gray shades to a minimum, because too many similar grays make contrast
  between adjacent surfaces indistinguishable.
- A label on a filled surface clears its fill by a real value gap. A dim tint of the fill color, or
  ink close in value to the surface behind it, leaves text the reader has to fight for.
- Use semantic token names in components, never a raw color value.
- Give a large surface one tone, and put headline emphasis in weight, scale, or a value step. A
  gradient blended across a background or poured into type reads as unchosen whichever pair of hues
  it takes, and blue into purple is the pair that arrives by default.

### Dark Mode

Dark mode is a paired color scale rather than a separate system. When adding a new token, define
both light and dark values together. Never invert hex values directly, because that shifts hues.
Adjust lightness while preserving chroma and hue. Token switching carries the whole scheme, so no
component branches on the mode.

Pure white on dark backgrounds causes eye strain. Use the off-white `--foreground` defined in
`src/styles.css`.

Declare `color-scheme` in each mode alongside the tokens, so the browser paints the scrollbars, the
native controls, and the caret in the same mode.

### Chart Colors

Chart colors are defined in `src/styles.css` in a fixed order. Assign data series in that order, and
give each series a second cue beyond hue, such as a marker shape, a dash pattern, or a direct label.

## Typography

### Fonts

`src/styles.css` does not override `--font-sans` or `--font-mono`, so Tailwind's system stacks
apply. A project that picks its own defines the body family and the monospace family there together,
matching stroke weight and proportions.

Where a project takes a display face, choose it for this product and self-host it, with one neutral
family under it for body text. `system-ui` is a genuine neutral, so it belongs under a display face
rather than carrying one.

### Typographic Rules

- Japanese body text needs wider line-height than Western text, because the characters are taller
  and denser.
- Body letter-spacing is slightly open (not solid-set).
- Heading letter-spacing is tighter (feels more composed at large sizes).
- Label and caption letter-spacing is wider (for scannability).

### Typographic Pitfalls

- Limit to 2 typefaces max (body + code).
- Keep body text line length under ~75 characters.
- Never center-align multi-line paragraphs.
- Maintain a clear typographic hierarchy. Where two text elements look the same weight and size, one
  of them is wrong.
- Set monospace where the content is data: a timestamp, a code, a price, a table. Captions, labels,
  and running copy take the body family.
- Give the small text roles different treatments. Where the eyebrow, the button label, the caption,
  and the footer line all wear the same tracked-out caps, the screen reads as a template instead of
  a voice.
- Set `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` where numbers line up for comparison, so the digits keep
  their columns.
- Keep a mobile input at 16px or larger, because iOS Safari zooms the page for anything smaller.
- Type the real characters: `…`, curly quotes, and a non-breaking space inside a measurement or a
  key combination.
- Font metrics (ascent/descent) create phantom padding that differs between design tools and
  browsers.

## Layout

### Spacing Tiers

Spacing follows Tailwind's default scale. Use the right tier for the right context: smallest for
intra-component gaps, medium for inter-component, largest for page structure.

### Spacing Rules

- Use parent `gap` (flex/grid), never per-element `margin`. Per-element margins collapse, double up,
  and require CSS changes when elements are removed. Inline siblings also pick up a space from the
  source newlines between them, which `flex` or `grid` on the parent removes.
- Never mix spacing scales in the same layout.
- `padding` is internal space, and `margin` is external space. Don't swap them.
- When line-height contributes to vertical rhythm, account for it in padding calculations, because
  the visual gap is line-height plus padding rather than padding alone.
- Respect the safe areas with `env(safe-area-inset-*)` where a fixed or full-bleed element reaches
  the viewport edge.
- Don't add padding to a child when the parent already provides it. Read the parent's styles before
  adding spacing to children, since doubling padding is a common cause of uneven gaps. External
  examples and copy-paste snippets often assume a different parent context, so always verify against
  the actual component you're composing into.

### Alignment

- Put parallel items on one grid, so the title, the body, and the control share a line across every
  column. Give the columns equal height, anchor the control to the bottom of each, and hold the slot
  of a value that is missing in one column. Copy length then stops deciding where a neighbor's
  content lands.
- Verify what the design centers rather than eyeballing it. In SVG, `text-anchor: middle` sets the
  horizontal alone, `dominant-baseline: central` or a measured `dy` sets the vertical, and a
  rotated, stroked, or padded shape moves where the center is.
- Give text a gutter from every edge it nears, and keep those gutters equal. A line that reaches the
  rim of its container reads as overflow.

## Shapes

Every radius tier derives from `--radius` in `src/styles.css`. Pick the tier that matches the
element's size, and do not introduce values outside the defined set.

Nest radii by subtracting the gap. An inner radius equals the outer radius minus the padding between
them, and where both take the same value, the two curves stop running parallel at the corner.

## Elevation

Hierarchy and separation come from background color difference, border, spacing, and typography,
never from shadow.

Shadow is limited to two cases:

- **Drag state**: the element being dragged gets shadow to communicate "lifted off the surface."
  Remove on drop.
- **Sticky header on scroll**: shadow appears dynamically when content scrolls beneath a sticky
  element. No shadow at rest.

In those two cases, cast the shadow from one direction with a small offset and a small blur, tinted
to the surface or to the element's own color. A bloom spread evenly on all sides, or a second box
placed behind the element to imitate one, reads as a sticker rather than a lit object.

Everything else uses border or backdrop dim for separation. Where a container needs an edge, shift
its surface a step from the background and stroke it with its own color at low opacity, which keeps
border, shadow, and text on one hue.

A translucent surface needs a backdrop worth showing through and a blur that blends at every edge.
Where the blur bands, the shadow leaks past the shape, or the effect jumps on hover, give the
element an opaque surface.

## Interaction & Content

### Interactive States

Every interactive element must define all five states: default, hover, focus-visible, active, and
disabled. Never remove the focus indicator.

A hover state changes fill, color, or an icon's position while the element keeps its size and place.
Reserve any lift for a card, and let a value shift carry it rather than a shadow.

Set `background` explicitly on every button, because the user-agent default differs across browsers.

Touch targets must be at least 44px × 44px. If the visual element is smaller, expand the hit area
with padding or a transparent pseudo-element.

Limit primary actions to one per screen. Require a confirmation step before destructive actions.
Labels belong outside input fields (no floating labels).

Every control on screen answers a click, confirmed by clicking it. Where something is a static prop,
give it the form of a label or a figure so nobody aims at it.

A control that starts a request keeps its label and adds a spinner, so its width holds and the
reader can see which action is running.

### Content States

Every data-displaying component must account for: loading, empty (zero results), error, and
populated states. Loading must show a visible indicator rather than a blank screen. A skeleton
mirrors the dimensions of the content it stands in for, so nothing shifts when the data lands. Error
messages must identify what went wrong and what the user can do.

Text and controls reach their visible state without JavaScript and without a scroll event. Animate
what is already on screen, so a reveal that never fires costs a transition instead of the content.

### Dynamic Content

Design for variable-length content. User names, titles, descriptions, and translations will
overflow, truncate, or wrap. Test every text container with:

- Single-character input
- Maximum-length input (or a long unbroken string)
- Multi-line overflow

Containers that accept user-generated text need explicit word-break handling. A flex child needs
`min-w-0` before `truncate` or `line-clamp-*` takes effect, because its default `min-width: auto`
refuses to shrink.

## CSS Architecture

### Sizing

Prefer `max-width` and `min-width` over fixed `width`. Prefer `min-height` over fixed `height`.
Components should flex with content rather than fight it. Take `auto-fit` in `repeat()` where the
tracks should stretch to fill the row, and `auto-fill` where the empty tracks should hold their
width.

### Overflow

`overflow: hidden` clips everything: shadows, positioned children, focus outlines. Use it only when
clipping is the explicit intent, never as a layout shortcut.

Where you add a clip, a notch, or a fixed height, pad the content clear of the cut by more than the
cut removes, then zoom into that edge and read it. Content that continues under an overlapping layer
stays on the layer that remains visible.

### Specificity

Avoid over-targeting selectors. `z-index` only works on positioned, flex, or grid children, never on
elements in normal flow.

### Animations

Animate `transform` and `opacity` only, never layout properties, which trigger reflow on every
frame.

## Decoration

A decoration earns its place by encoding information. Each form below arrives by reflex when nothing
was decided, so the bullet names the move that replaces it.

- **Place a mark bare.** A tile, chip, or circle behind an icon or a logo carries nothing, so size
  and color the mark itself.
- **Rank with type, weight, and spacing.** A hairline beside a label, a dot under the active nav
  item, and a colored bar down a card's edge each stand in for structure they do not hold.
- **Contain a status only where it needs the container.** The rest of the metadata sits in the type
  hierarchy rather than in a pill of its own.
- **Vary how a section begins.** A number, an image, or a full sentence each open one. A small label
  above a large heading arrives on its own, and an eyebrow badge above an H1 is the same move.
- **Separate two actions by weight or placement.** A filled button paired with an outlined one is
  the default action row, and it carries no decision about which of the two matters.
- **Draw the stock parts for this product.** The theme switch, the step sequence, the feature row,
  and the avatar each have one default form that carries no decision, and a sun-and-moon toggle is
  the clearest of them.
- **Let a background be one considered surface.** A sheet of faint grid lines reads as graph paper
  at any opacity, and a blurred blob of accent color bleeding from a corner is the same reflex in
  color.

## Composition

Passing every rule above leaves a screen that breaks nothing. What makes it a design is a decision
this screen carries that another product could not take unchanged. Decide that first, then build the
sections from it.

- Hold one palette, one type voice, and one geometry across the screen. Parts that are each correct
  and belong to nothing read as incoherent before any single part reads as wrong.
- Choose the surface tone for this product. A neutral that reads as tasteful is still the tone that
  arrives on its own, and which neutral reads that way turns over every year or two.
- Compose the screen as a whole. Presets compound, so a run of blocks that each pass on their own
  still reads as one template with the content swapped.
- Build on the primitives in `src/components/ui/` and restyle what you take. Taking a prebuilt
  block's behavior costs nothing, and taking its styling costs the identity.
